# Context Delivery Profile v7

Profile 7 is the public Camp profile paired with [ContextManifest 26](context-manifest-evidence-v26.md).
Single Chat continues to use Profile 6.

At claim, Core resolves the selected Runtime/model `maxContextPayloadBytes`; an absent capability defaults
to `96 * 1024` UTF-8 bytes. There is no common 1 MiB clamp. Mandatory fixed sections and the largest
complete FIFO `RUN_INPUT.messages[]` prefix are selected first. Optional `SHARED_CONVERSATION` and other
optional context consume only the remainder.

An input message, including body, quotes, attachment metadata and selected Skills, is indivisible. Core
does not truncate or summarize it. If the queue head alone cannot fit, Core creates an evidence-bearing
preflight-failed Run (`context_payload_too_large`) without sending bytes to the Runtime, settles that
Delivery as failed, and permits later queue work to continue.

Shared history takes the latest 15 eligible messages, then the latest complete suffix that fits the
remaining bytes, and emits it in ascending sequence. Any real omitted candidate produces both
`omittedCount` and an opaque `historyReadCursor`.
