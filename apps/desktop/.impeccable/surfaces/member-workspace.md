# Member workspace surface brief

## User goal

Inspect the current roster, understand each teammate's role and availability, and safely create,
edit or remove a teammate without confusing identity with Runtime state.

## Information priority

1. The persistent App navigation and the active roster.
2. Selected teammate identity, team role, Presence and Runtime availability.
3. Professional profile, work principles and personality background.
4. Runtime configuration and the directly visible Runtime Parameters.
5. Memory Capability and destructive removal.

## First view and layout

Use the shared App rail on the teammate page; its width and complete collapse follow the App Shell contract.
All split boundaries, including the roster, highlight their full 1px line with `--resize-line` on hover or drag; never add a short thicker grip.
The roster shares the detail's workspace
surface (white in Day), with a 1px divider separating the two reading planes. Its default width is 256px;
expanded widths range from 192px to 360px and protect 400px for the detail when space permits.
Use the shared fold gesture from [DESIGN.md](../../../../DESIGN.md#components), folding to a 76px avatar rail.
Dragging a collapsed rail to 208px expands it. Escape restores the pre-gesture layout; blur, lost capture and
container-width changes settle the last observed position. Page changes discard the stale gesture.
The 9px pointer target stays mounted through collapse and supports dragging open again.
Expanding restores the useful width before the collapse gesture. Remember width and
collapse locally; viewport clamping does not overwrite
the chosen width. Double-click or Home restores 256px, arrows resize and collapse/expand at the boundary,
and Enter toggles collapse. The separate collapse button and roster options menu are absent. A reorder gesture temporarily disables
the splitter. The detail scrolls internally instead of shrinking identity or actions below usability.

The header uses one compact avatar, name, role and Presence. Remove the repeated Runtime shortcut from this
header; the roster and Runtime configuration retain their existing status and navigation. The entire overflow
button keeps hover, open and touch feedback outside the window drag region. Avatar changes open a dialog directly.

## Roster and order

Roster order comes from the authoritative Member Order. Reordering is explicit, keyboard accessible
and preserves selection. Identity color and avatar remain stable across reorder. Loading or partial
Runtime health must not reorder or hide teammates.

Roster rows keep a 40px circular image, 13px name and 11px role in a 60px row without inter-row gaps.
Use a subtle selected surface without a selection rail and keep the Runtime column aligned. The header shows the total
once; omit the redundant “在队” group when every teammate is present. If any teammate is away, show
the meaningful presence groups and their counts. Above eight members, offer compact name/role search;
the title reports matching / total counts while filtering. Keep one compact “+ Add” action with a separate dropdown arrow,
without an enclosing border or divider; each button has neutral hover/focus feedback and a 44px mobile touch height.
AI conversation remains the default, manual creation stays in its dropdown. New AI conversations prefill the localized,
editable request defined by Member Creation Flow v1 without sending; language changes and return navigation preserve edits.
Reorder rows directly
(on mobile, drag the avatar); preserve the avatar without an overlay handle. Alt+Up/Down and row context-menu
actions provide keyboard movement within the same presence group. The resize divider remains available.
Runtime shortcuts show the existing product logo in a 22px carrier; an unconfigured teammate uses a neutral
minus glyph. Attention, unsupported and unqualified states add a small `!` marker. Loading retains the
product identity with a checking label. Each shortcut has an accessible action label and product tooltip;
only checking or actionable states add status/detail. It scrolls
to that teammate's Runtime configuration. A small dirty dot and accessible “有未保存更改” label identify pending edits.
`ready`、`light_ready` 和 `installed_unverified` 不附加“可用”或“可尝试运行”，也不在 tooltip、accessible
label 或配置区常驻解释验证机制。配置区保留已知版本。加载或复扫期间保留产品图标并按现有状态标注检查中，
不得把延迟验证画成失败。

## Detail and editing

Keep a fixed personal-profile entry above the teammate roster, outside counts, search and ordering.
It selects an ordinary detail page with a single-column avatar and name form, capped at 520px. Both defaults are “你”;
renaming keeps that glyph until an image is uploaded. Show the name without an added “· 你” suffix;
keep “个人资料” as the entry subtitle. Reuse the existing circular cropper. Save both fields
together, keep drafts when selecting teammates, and include this editor in the workspace leave guard.
The entry remains clickable above the native window drag strip. Its production semantics are owned by
[Current User Profile v1](../../../../docs/contracts/current-user-profile-v1.md).

Identity editing uses one avatar file with display framing metadata: crop drag, zoom and keyboard nudge
after upload, without actual-size previews or an independent half-body portrait. The durable asset and fallback rules are in
[`member-identity.md`](../../../../docs/ui/components/member-identity.md).

“运行配置” retains the product Runtime, model, reasoning, permission and sandbox fields exposed by
that Runtime. The Runtime, model and permissions save atomically through the existing command. Keep
“运行参数” directly visible by default in the vertical reading flow. Do not restore the removed
“高级设置”, summary-model configuration or “对话压缩模型”.

Normal roster and detail views omit permanent availability or verification explanations; show actionable problems only.
Fast changes the saved preference without starting an eligibility check. Retain the Runtime name and known version;
version ownership follows [Runtime Launch v64](../../../../docs/contracts/runtime-launch-and-verification-v64.md).

For any `light_ready` installation, expose Runtime default model plus only permissions described by the
static Adapter schema. Login and protocol setup happen in the real task Host; do not add
routine copy explaining that mechanism. Native choices require catalog evidence; manually entered IDs only record user intent
and are sent to the native Runtime for acceptance. TRAE uses the same model
catalog cache and Picker behavior as every other Runtime; its permission draft still defaults to the statically
admitted highest value `permission_mode=bypass_permissions`. Kiro exposes the existing compact switch pattern for
`trust_all_tools`; label it “自动允许全部工具” and default it on from Core without adding a separate warning card.
Every boolean Runtime permission switch on this page uses the current theme action family for its on state across
Desktop, Web and Mobile; it does not fall back to the Steel brand family.
Use the accepted understated permission guidance from the [member configuration UI contract](../../../../docs/ui/components/member-identity.md#队员配置页): ordinary recommendation text appears only inside an open menu, with one short line below switches. The inline permission switch face and its minimum height are both 36px. Guidance never changes a saved value or draft, and language changes preserve both.

Model rows keep Runtime display names separate from opaque selection IDs and show the Runtime description when
provided, with the full text available on hover. Claude's native control catalog uses this same Picker; no family-specific
rows or inferred version labels are supplied by Renderer.

Opening the model Picker uses Core-owned stale-while-revalidate state. Fresh catalogs display immediately;
stale and same-identity expired catalogs remain interactive while a single background refresh runs. Only absence
of displayable history shows loading; identity invalidation retains Core's existing rules. The catalog never gates a saved or explicit native selection. A failed refresh keeps the list and shows “尚未核对”, with “重试” available. Normal closed controls show
only the model and parameters, not TTL maintenance copy. Saving explicit configuration does not wait for catalog verification.
Switching Runtime never triggers discovery, and an older async result must not mutate the new draft.
Runtime default remains selectable without a catalog. The search input also accepts an exact model ID. For nonempty,
trimmed input absent from the native catalog and current manual selection, show “使用 {ID}” / “Use {ID}” in the result list.
Do not add a permanent action, badge or second editor. The current catalog-absent ID appears as an ordinary selected row;
choosing another model removes that manual row. Save only the current explicit selection, preserving existing explicit options within the same Runtime, never
a custom catalog or recent-ID list. The model catalog uses native Runtime configuration plus shared Runtime variables; member overrides stay local to member execution.

Keep presence and destructive removal in the header overflow menu. Removal uses its existing confirmation
and Core preview. Do not expose Installation IDs, executable paths or internal bindings in the ordinary profile.

On Windows, Runtime Platform Admission is evaluated before installation or health. An unqualified row
uses the Runtime logo with a compact `!` marker with the full label “{Runtime}：Windows 尚未验证”; an unsupported row says
“此平台不支持”. Neither may be shown as not installed, rescannable or temporarily checking. Opening the
configuration shows frozen historical values but no Runtime/model/permission mutation or execution action.
Name, role, avatar and other unrelated edits remain available and save while preserving the Runtime
subobject exactly; the Renderer must not manufacture a default or require users to discard that history.

Cursor Agent remains a closed identity and does not enter the ordinary member Runtime selector until a
future contract explicitly opens it. A historically persisted Cursor configuration stays frozen and readable;
unrelated member edits preserve that Runtime subobject exactly, while the Renderer must not manufacture its
`execution_mode` or `approval_policy` defaults or offer a new Cursor selection.

Kimi Code follows the same admission-first rule and is currently qualified on macOS arm64, macOS x64 and
Windows x64. Its model and `default | plan | auto | yolo` permission selector therefore follow the ordinary
available Runtime flow when machine readiness also passes. Read-only workspace always projects effective `plan`;
provider credentials remain private Core configuration and never appear in this surface. Kimi/Grok ACP agent
text is not provider-cleaned: when an upstream Runtime emits thinking tags as ordinary assistant text, process
detail and the resulting final candidate retain that text exactly like every other ACP Runtime.

The member Runtime chooser displays Pi Coding Agent as “PI” immediately after Antigravity; the member sidebar uses the same short label.
Pi Coding Agent is a qualified Product Runtime on macOS arm64, macOS x64 and Windows x64. Keep it selectable and
editable through the ordinary Runtime flow on all three platforms, without an experimental suffix, while continuing
to show real machine availability independently. Qualification does not weaken installation, model or Dispatch checks.
Pi tools follow native Pi semantics; Rovai exposes no Pi approval or sandbox configuration. Its member Runtime
parameters therefore show model fields only.

## Removal

Permanent removal is blocked while the teammate owns a non-terminal AgentRun. Otherwise the Chinese
confirmation shows the Camps they will leave and the number of unfinished Tasks whose responsibility
will be released. The Renderer presents the Core preview and result; it does not independently close
membership, Task or Lead state.

On conflict or failure, keep the dialog, selection, draft edits and focus. Do not claim partial
removal succeeded.

## Inheritance and hard boundaries

Inherit root [`DESIGN.md`](../../../../DESIGN.md), both theme contracts, the shared accessibility
baseline and [member identity contract](../../../../docs/ui/components/member-identity.md). This brief
cannot change AgentProfile fields, Member Order semantics, Runtime catalogs, removal transactions or
Memory authority.

## Inline configuration composition

The right pane is one continuous page: “身份信息” followed by “运行配置”, with no identity/Runtime Tabs
and no create/edit dialogs. Name and team role share a row; professional responsibilities follow. Personality,
principles and growth share a collapsed “更多设定” disclosure with an optional “已设置” label, never a completion count.
Collapsing preserves drafts; validation expands and focuses the field. Avatar selection and framing use their own dialog.

Each section owns its “放弃更改” and theme primary save control: a 14px outline save icon plus “保存”, with full accessible names “保存队员信息” / “保存运行配置”. Member selection preserves
both sections' pending drafts for each visited teammate. Saving one section advances its accepted baseline
without resetting the other. A conflicting external update preserves the local draft and blocks that section's
save until the user reloads its saved values. Leaving the workspace confirms discarding pending changes.
The environment editor does not add its own “已保存。” line; saving uses the enclosing Runtime section's
existing clean state and disabled save/discard controls.

New teammates use the same page. The pending draft has a separate bottom roster row and is excluded from
saved teammate counts and ordering. Only a name is required. Runtime configuration becomes available after
creation. Avatar changes open a dialog: upload is primary, presets are collapsed by default, and removal is a quiet footer action. Upload switches the same dialog to “裁切头像”; confirm creates a draft and the identity section’s save commits the reference. Cancel retains the existing avatar and text drafts.
Creation includes the selected image in the existing create command. Existing identity and image changes use
successive existing commands with receipt versions; partial success explicitly distinguishes committed text
from an unsaved image, retains the remaining draft and never claims an atomic transaction.

Keep Runtime/model/permission dropdown geometry, colors, borders, menu and selection unchanged; only remove extra focus outlines/halos. Model changes preserve compatible explicit overrides as specified in the [member configuration UI contract](../../../../docs/ui/components/member-identity.md#队员配置页). The Runtime picker shows the existing product icons in its trigger and keyboard-accessible menu. The model
field is labeled “模型” and its Runtime-default caption is “默认”; the underlying `runtime_default` mode and Runtime-native fields,
raw choices, defaults, platform admission, model discovery and recovery remain unchanged. Do not introduce
an additional Runtime parameters heading in this continuous form.

The compact header and identity form use one column when space narrows, without a portrait column.
Personality, principles and growth are collapsed together under “更多设定”; validation reveals the affected fields.
All registered palettes keep the same geometry, semantic roles and restrained 1px input borders. Primary buttons
and sliders follow the shared theme action rules. Preserve destructive removal preview, blockers, errors and keyboard operation.

The production-component regression is `node --test scripts/lib/member-editor.test.mjs`. It runs an isolated
Electron fixture, covers both saves, cross-member drafts, conflicts, inline creation, keyboard focus and
1440×920 / 1040×700 / 2560×1440 / 200% layouts, and can retain screenshots with
`ROVAI_KEEP_MEMBER_EDITOR_FIXTURE=1`. This fixture contains explicit test data; production always reads Core.

The Runtime save row also offers “应用到其他队员 →” as an unboxed secondary text action with underline on hover/focus.
On mobile it occupies a left-aligned row with a 44px touch height. Use the already saved configuration as the immutable source;
disable the entry for pending Runtime edits, conflicts, active saving or a frozen configuration. The neutral dialog
shows the source snapshot and a selectable roster, preselecting only unconfigured targets. Existing configurations
require selection and an inline replacement preview. Runtime drafts, busy targets and frozen configurations cannot
be overwritten; independent identity drafts survive. Per-target receipt, retry and unknown-outcome behavior belongs
to the [member configuration UI contract](../../../../docs/ui/components/member-identity.md#应用运行配置到其他队员).
Mobile presents the same content in a bottom sheet with fixed actions and 44px touch controls. Keep all registered palettes,
language switching and native Runtime values on this same component tree. `pnpm test:member-runtime-apply` verifies
the production component with explicit transport fixtures, including unknown responses, version conflicts, phone
portrait/landscape and zoom; no real Runtime or daily profile participates.

Selected roster rows use a neutral surface and text without a left selection rail. Keep the roster background and identity assets unchanged.

Environment values are directly visible in the existing JSON textarea, without a reveal control or an add-variable entry.
Accept string, number and boolean values; preview and submit their string forms, preserve raw drafts until save succeeds.
Keep the existing save/discard flow without a permanent input hint. An empty editor shows only the shared
JSON placeholder `{ "VARIABLE_NAME": "value" }`; the example is not draft content or a saved value.
The boundary is [Runtime Launch v69](../../../../docs/contracts/runtime-launch-and-verification-v69.md).
